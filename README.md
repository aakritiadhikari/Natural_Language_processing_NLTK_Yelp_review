# Natural_Language_processing_NLTK_Yelp_review
This is classification of YELP_reviews into 1star or 5 star. Dataset is available in Kaggle. Here, I used countvectorizer, TF-IDF transformer. It is similar to previous spam/ham classification problem. Here, I take 'review' text as feature and 'stars' as label for my classifier. I used SVM and Naive Bayes classifier. For text processing, scikit learn pipeline method is better. Result obtained shows that SVM performs better than NB classifier for this dataset. However, result obtained shows that TF-IDF transformer decreases performance of NB for this dataset. Therefore, I tried doing it without TF-IDF transformer and in  yelp_review_one.ipynb file, performance of NB improved in good way.
